<h1>🌟 Diabetes Prediction Model 🚀</h1>

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Model project! This tool helps predict whether a patient is diabetic based on their health data. Using machine learning, we’ve built an intelligent system that analyzes factors like glucose levels, age, and BMI to classify a patient as diabetic or not. 💡

🎯 Project Overview
--

This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, a real-world dataset that includes medical details of patients. By training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on this dataset, we’re able to predict diabetes outcomes with high accuracy! 🏥

🧑‍💻 Getting Started
--

Before you get started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed. These libraries will allow you to run the code and explore the data:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Requirements:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

📊 The Dataset
--

This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database, which contains health data of 768 patients. It has the following features:

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Glucose concentration
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure value
- SkinThickness: Thickness of the skin fold
- Insulin: Insulin levels
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function based on the family history of diabetes
- Age: Patient’s age
- Outcome: 1 (diabetic) or 0 (non-diabetic)

🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model
--

The magic happens in these simple steps:

Data Preprocessing: First, we standardize the data to make sure all features are on the same scale.
Splitting Data: We divide the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
Training the Model: We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel for the prediction.

🔍 Evaluating the Model
--

We measure the model’s performance using accuracy scores:

Training Data Accuracy: 78.66 %
Test Data Accuracy: 77.27 %

🚀 Usage
--

You can quickly make predictions for a new patient using the following code:

input_data = (1, 132, 62, 13, 36, 25.5, 0.393, 22)

#### Convert input to numpy array
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)

#### Reshape the array for prediction
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)

#### Standardize the input data
std_data = scalar.transform(input_data_reshaped)

#### Predict using the trained model
prediction = classifier.predict(std_data)

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("Patient is Not Diabetic")
else:
    print("Patient is Diabetic")
The model will tell you whether the patient is diabetic based on the input data. 🌟

🚧 To Do and Future Plans
--
This is just the beginning! There are many ways we can improve this project:

More Features: We can add more patient details to improve accuracy.
Visualization: Add graphs and charts to visualize the performance of the model.
Deploy the Model: We can deploy the model as a web app for easy predictions on the go. 🌍
